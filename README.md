🍫 Feastables – MrBeast-Inspired Funky Chocolate Store

Just wrapped up my submission for the Sheryians Frontend Hackathon 2025 — and it’s as wild as it sounds!

This project is a Feastables-style chocolate shop built with all the frontend magic I could throw in: animations, 3D models, smooth scrolling, and a UI that pops.
